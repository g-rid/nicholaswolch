Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my portfolio.

I'm a tech nerd from Sonoma, CA happily plugging away as a front-end web developer. I've got a design background and I'm fluent in the Adobe suite. In the last few years I've been enjoying learning more advanced Javascript and PHP.

I started building this portfolio site with vanilla JS but halfway through I decided to use Vue. I'm currently working on a Vue web app which I'll throw up here when ready.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions - hey@nicholaswolch.com
